Tidying up depends on how much your mess is affecting your productivity and well-being. If it's just an "organized chaos" that doesn't bother you, maybe it's fine as it is. But if it’s making things harder to find or causing stress, it might be time to organize.

If you don’t know where to start, try this:

1. **Sort by priority** – What do you actually need often? Keep those accessible.
2. **One small area at a time** – Instead of tackling everything, start with a single desk, shelf, or section.
3. **Declutter first** – Remove things you don’t use or need.
4. **Use containers or categories** – Group similar things together to make finding them easier.

If you want a minimalist approach, the goal is to **keep only what you truly need and use** while eliminating the rest. Here’s how you can do it:

### **1. The One-Pass Rule**

Go through your stuff **once** and make quick decisions:

- **Keep** (only if you use or truly need it)
- **Discard** (trash, donate, or sell)
- **Store away** (for things you don’t use daily but still need)

### **2. Start with the Most Annoying Spot**

Pick the area that bothers you the most (desk, shelf, or clothes pile). Once that’s clean, you’ll feel instant relief.

### **3. Apply the “90/90 Rule”**

If you **haven’t used it in 90 days and won’t use it in the next 90 days**, consider letting it go.

### **4. Keep Surfaces Clear**

Flat spaces (desk, table, bed) attract clutter. Try keeping them as empty as possible—just essentials.

### **5. Digital & Paper Declutter**

Minimalism isn’t just physical. Clear your files, emails, and notes. If you don’t need them, delete them.

### **6. Stop Bringing in More**

Every new item should either replace something or have a clear function.

Minimalism isn’t about having nothing—it’s about having just **enough**. How much "stuff" do you actually feel comfortable with?

### **Decide Where to Store Your Files**

**Main Options:**

- **Cloud Storage** (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox) → Good for access from anywhere
- **Local Storage** (External HDD, SSD, or NAS) → Good for privacy & large files
- **Hybrid Approach** → Important files in the cloud, big archives in local storage

If security is a concern, consider **encrypted storage** like Cryptomator or VeraCrypt.

### **Create a Folder Structure**

A clean hierarchy makes finding things **instant**. Example:

📂  Projects  
   ├── 📁 Web Dev  
   ├── 📁 Design  
   ├── 📁 Writing  
📂  Personal  
   ├── 📁 Photos  
   │   ├── 📁 2024  
   │   ├── 📁 2023  
   │   └── 📁 Old Photos  
   ├── 📁 Documents  
📂  Downloads (clear this out regularly)
📂  Archive (rarely used files)

Key ideas:  
✔ **Use categories** that make sense to you  
✔ **Year-based folders** for things like photos, projects, or documents  
✔ **Separate active vs. archived** files

### **Automate & Maintain**

- **Use sync tools** (Google Backup & Sync, Syncthing)
- **Automate backups** (weekly/monthly)
- **Use a consistent naming system** (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_ProjectName`)
- **Declutter regularly** (schedule a review once a month or quarter)

### **Where to Store Photos & Videos?**

If you take a lot of pictures:

- **Google Photos / Apple Photos** (automatic backup)
- **Local HDD/SSD** (for high-quality versions)
- **Organize by Year & Event** (`2024 > Birthday`, `2024 > Trip to Japan`)

### **Handling Paperwork & Notes**

- Convert **physical documents** to PDFs using a scanner or phone
- Store **notes & ideas** in **Notion, Obsidian, or Evernote**

### My Plan for Organizing Files & Photos:

1. **Main Folders (Top-Level):**
    - **Work** (Projects, Code, Documents)
    - **Personal** (Photos, Notes, Finance)
    - **Temp/Downloads** (Clear periodically)
2. **Inside Each Folder:**
    - Work: Organize by project name or client.
    - Photos: Sort by year/event or just "Favorites" vs. "Archive."
    - Temp: Clear out every few months.
3. **Storage & Syncing:**
    - Use cloud storage for essential files.
    - Keep a local backup for important work.
4. **Decluttering Habit:**
    - Set a reminder every 3-6 months to clean up files.
    - Delete or archive files once you realize they’re unnecessary.
