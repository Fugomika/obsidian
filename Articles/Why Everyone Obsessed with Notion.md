## Notion is Build Based on Three Psychological Effects

### 1. The Ikea Effect
People tend to value things that they build themselves so much. Notion users will have to have to tweak, make, and modify the pages to suit their preferences and build a sense of ==fulfillment==.
### 2. Maslow's Hammer
"Once someone has a tool that they're familiar with, they want to use it for anything".
"Maslow's Hammer" or "Law of the Instrument" is a cognitive bias written by Abraham Maslow. It simply stated that ==if you have a hammer, everything becomes a nail==. Just like with notion, we wanted to use it for everything.
### 3. Metagame
For example, pokemon. It has a large community, tutorials, events, and even YouTube channels talking about it which is broader than the game itself. Something that influences the game itself is called metagame or =="A game beyond the game"==. People tend to create anything about notions like blogs, videos, and even website frameworks. Marketing strategy starts free for themselves, and later someone brings it to a company~.
