You didn’t stumble upon this by accident. If you’re reading this, **Allah wanted you to see it**.

I’m not some algorithm expert who strategically placed this message in front of you. No, you are here because **Allah chose you**.

Like many on the journey of self-improvement, I once fixated on **financial success**—making 10K per month, retiring my parents, traveling the world, and achieving financial freedom. If you have the same goals, that same fire in your heart, then listen closely:

There’s an **Islamic secret** you need to know to ensure your success.

## **Allah Placed That Desire in Your Heart**

Every desire in our hearts comes from Allah. Whether it’s the longing for **love, success, friendship, or financial freedom**, these are all **tests**.

- If you desire love, will you seek it in **halal** ways or fall into haram relationships?
- If you desire success, will you pursue it **ethically**, or will you take shortcuts and compromise your values?
- If you desire financial freedom, will you use it to **benefit others**, or will you chase wealth for selfish gain?

The **desires we have are not random**—they are tests from Allah to shape us into better people.

## **Your Duty: To Carry Out This Desire the Right Way**

Allah **doesn’t care about how much money you make**. He doesn’t ask, “Did you hit 10K per month?” or “Did you retire your parents?”

Instead, Allah cares about:  
✔ **The person you become in the process.**  
✔ **The discipline you develop.**  
✔ **How close you get to Him while pursuing your goals.**  
✔ **How you use your blessings to uplift others.**

On the **Day of Judgment**, it won’t be about the money in your bank account—it will be about **how you earned it and what you did with it**.

Money itself is **neither good nor bad**—it’s a tool. What **truly** matters is how you use it.

## **The Risk of Ignoring Your Calling**

Many people live **mediocre** lives—stuck in 9-to-5 jobs, never pushing themselves, settling for less.

It’s not because they never **had** a desire for more. It’s because they once did, but they **ignored it**.

🔴 They never pushed to excel in school.  
🔴 They never challenged themselves to grow.  
🔴 They never sought improvement in their personal or spiritual lives.

And so, **Allah stopped giving them the desire for more**.

Just like how **Allah chooses who gets His light**, He also decides who **gets the drive to succeed**. The fact that you **still feel that hunger**—that longing for something greater—**is proof that Allah wants more for you**.

## **You Have a Responsibility to Pursue Your Potential**

Be grateful for your ambitions because they mean **Allah has a plan for you**. **You are the steward of this desire.**

That means **you get to decide**:  
✔ Will you chase it with purpose?  
✔ Will you build discipline to achieve it?  
✔ Will you become the man Allah planned for you to be?

Or will you ignore it and settle for mediocrity?

## **Discipline: The Key to Fulfilling Your Potential**

Your dreams will **never** come to life without **discipline**.

At the end of the day, **Allah loves the man who is disciplined**—the one who sees **haram temptations** and stays away, the one who passes the tests of life **with patience and resilience**.

A Muslim **without discipline** is a Muslim **who will struggle**.

Without discipline:  
❌ You’ll fail in your pursuit of success.  
❌ You’ll fail in your **deen**.  
❌ You’ll fail in your responsibilities as a **leader, husband, or father**.

Discipline is the difference between those who **achieve their God-given potential** and those who **waste it**.

## **Entrepreneurs Will Change the Ummah**

This isn’t just about you. **The state of the Ummah is a reflection of us as individuals.**

The Ummah is suffering—not because of external forces, but because we are **weak and divided**.

We need **strong, disciplined, and successful Muslims** to **take back power**. Entrepreneurs and leaders have always **changed the world**, and **Muslim entrepreneurs will be the ones to save the Ummah**.

That’s why I share this message.

## **Final Thoughts: Answer the Call**

Allah placed this desire in your heart **for a reason**.

💡 **Do not ignore it.**  
💡 **Do not let it fade.**  
💡 **Do not waste the opportunity Allah has given you.**

This is your **test**. **Your calling**. **Your responsibility.**

The question is—**what will you do with it?**
