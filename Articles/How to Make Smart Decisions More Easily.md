> In 2011, researchers studied a group of judges to determine what factors influence a prisoner's chance of receiving parole. While many believe that behavior, the nature of the crime, and previous sentences are the primary considerations, one surprising variable had a significant impact: **the time of day**.

The study revealed that prisoners who appeared in court in the morning were more likely to receive parole than those who appeared later in the day. This is thought to be due to **decision fatigue**â€”a state where mental exhaustion from making too many decisions leads to less favorable outcomes. By the afternoon, judges were more fatigued, resulting in harsher decisions.

Everyone has a daily limit on decision-making capacity. Once we reach that threshold, our choices tend to become more impulsive and less confident. The complexity and stakes of a decision also affect how quickly we experience fatigue. For instance, deciding what to eat for breakfast is a low-stakes decision with limited options, which allows us to recover quickly and make more decisions later. In contrast, purchasing a new phone on a limited budget requires more time, research, and mental effort, pushing us closer to our decision-making limit.

To avoid decision fatigue, the following strategies can help:
1. **Reduce the number of daily decisions**: Spread tasks over multiple days or eliminate routine decisions, like pre-planning meals or outfits.
2. **Gain perspective**: Imagine your decision as someone else's, which can help you evaluate it more objectively and reduce emotional strain.
3. **Prioritize choices**: Recognize that not all choices are equally important. Save your energy for significant decisions and relax about the smaller ones. ==(Like whether or not to close your browser tabs haha)==

By applying these strategies, we can avoid exhaustion and improve our ability to make smarter, more thoughtful decisions.
