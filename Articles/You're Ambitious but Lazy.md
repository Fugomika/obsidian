So, you’re ambitious. You’ve got big dreams and want to live the life you’ve always imagined. But there’s a catch—you’re lazy. You know what you _should_ be doing, but you don’t do it. And that leads to guilt, because deep down, you know you’re capable of so much more.

Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, and eventually, that guilt fades into acceptance. Then the New Year rolls around, and with it, the same goals as last year. You start off strong, powered by motivation and maybe a little delusion. But before long, procrastination sneaks in—like that one relative who always shows up uninvited.

Suddenly, procrastination becomes routine. The cycle repeats, and you start labeling yourself as "lazy."

So how do you break free? How do you stop procrastinating for good?

Most advice out there tackles the symptoms: delete social media, remove distractions, etc. While helpful in the short term, they miss the real issue—the root cause of procrastination: **inertia.**

In physics, inertia is an object’s tendency to stay at rest—or in motion—until acted upon by an external force. And tasks work the same way. Starting anything, no matter how small, takes effort to overcome that initial inertia.

The problem? We make that first push feel impossible by setting the stakes too high. So instead of starting, we avoid the task entirely and distract ourselves with easier, dopamine-filled activities.

To break procrastination, we need to break inertia. Here’s how:

1. **Reduce the stakes.**  
    Getting started is the hardest part, so make it ridiculously easy. Instead of saying, “I need to finish this 5,000-word essay,” say, “I’ll just write 50 words.” Suddenly, it feels doable, and inertia doesn’t stand a chance.
    
2. **Use the Two-Minute Rule.**  
    If a task feels overwhelming, commit to doing it for just two minutes. For example, if you don’t feel like cleaning your room, put on a song and stop when it ends. Most of the time, you’ll keep going because once you’re in motion, it’s easier to stay in motion.
    

That’s the beauty of momentum. At first, it feels like pushing a ball uphill. But once you break inertia, it’s all downhill from there.

These methods work for everything—going to the gym, building a side hustle, maintaining relationships, and more.

As Martin Luther King Jr. said, “You don’t have to see the whole staircase; just take the first step.”
